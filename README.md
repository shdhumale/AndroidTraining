======

1- Create an adapter
2- Create viewHolder inside adapter
3- make the adapter of type viewholder
4- create the constructor and the local list
5- implement the 3 methods
6- use glide in onBindViewHolder (add dependency)
7- in MainActivity add a layout mananger for the recycleView
8- set adapter to teh RecycleView
9- add internet permission to the manifest

- Adding handler to card
1- Create Activity
2- Override onCreate
3- Design Layout with WebView
4- Mention in menifest
5- use setcontentview in DetailsActivity
6- add id to cardview
7- update adapter: viewholder
8- add an onclicklistener in onBindViewHolder
9.show toast with position

==========
things to do

In the details activity get the position from the intent
Based on the position get the NewsObject at that position
Based on the news object a) change the title of the activity b) load the url (you have to initialize the webview)
Create a horizontal progress bar in the details activity
Show/Hide the progress bar when the page starts loading/finishes loading
Implement "up functionality" in your details activity so that when you click on "up", you go back to the previous screen



------Day 3
1- Get the response from newsapi
2- Make sure it is valid (jsonparseronline or other parsing tools): http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/
3- Go to jsonschematopojo: http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/
4- Paste the response (valid)
5- Change the source type to json
6- Give the correct packagename
7- Give the correct class name (any class name)
8- Change the annotation style to gson
9- Download and extract the zip file
9- Copy the files to the object package
10- Include the gson dependency: compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.7'
11- Remove the generated annotation as well as the generated import to remove all errors

--- Day 3 retrofit
1-Add the following to build.gradle
```
    compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.1.0'
    compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.1.0'
```
2-Create a networking package
3-Create a NewsAPI class inside the networking package
4-Define the API_KEY and BASE_URL as constants
5-Define an interface: NewsAPIInterface
6-Create a method for each endpoint, pass source and sortBy as query parameters
7-Annotate it with GET with the particular endpoint url along with the KEY
8-define a static NewsAPIInterface object
9-Create a static getNewsAPI method which will help us in accessing the singleton
10-in case the NewsAPIInterface is null, create an instance of Retrofit with a) the basurl b) the gson converter
11-create an instance of the newsapiinterface
12-In MainActivity, use NewsAPI.getNewsAPI().getArticles to get Call
13-use call.enqueue to get a callback for the network response
14-in the onResponse callback, use response.body() to get the NewsApiArticleResponse object
15-Use breakpoints/debugging to verify the response

----Day 3 Retrofit

1- Remove NewsObjects
2- Create CommonStuff.java and add a static List there, create getters and setters
  public class CommonStuff {
      public static List<Article> articles;

      public static List<Article> getArticles() {
          return articles;
      }

      public static void setArticles(List<Article> articles) {
          CommonStuff.articles = articles;
      }
  }
3- Update Adapter to reflect the following:
    - update the list from NewsObjects to Article
    - update constructor
    - update all the places where we access the NewsObject
4- When a response comes in MainActivity, do the following
    - store it in CommonStuff
    - create the adapter with the List we receive from the response like so:
  ```
  NewsApiArticleResponse newsApiArticleResponse = response.body();
  CommonStuff.setArticles(newsApiArticleResponse.getArticles());
  NewsAdapter newsAdapter = new NewsAdapter(newsApiArticleResponse.getArticles());
  ```
10- load the recyclerview like before
11- show the progressbar before the loading begins
12- hide it once the response is received
13- Update DetailsActivity like so:
14- get the List instead of List from CommonStuff
15- update NewsObjects references to Article

Day-3-Retrofit - Source-Article-All Applications
 1-Create a new Activity, call it SourcesActivity (Use New>Activity>Empty Activity)
 2-Also give change its intent-filter to Main and Launcher, so that it launches when the app is opened
 3-Write the retrofit API definition for the sources endpoint, which includes
    -getting a sample json response from newsapi.org
    -validating it in jsoneditoronline
    -creating the object (described before) in jsonshcematopojo
    -import the objects in our app
    -write a new method in our NewsAPI interface like so:
    ```
       @GET("sources")
       Call<NewsApiSourcesResponse> getSources();
    ```
 4-Add support for storing and retrieving the Sources in CommonStuff
 ```
     public static List<Source> sources;
     public static List<Source> getSources() {
         return sources;
     }
     public static void setSources(List<Source> sources) {
         CommonStuff.sources = sources;
     }
  ```
 5-Create "SourceAdapter" for our SourceActivity
    -create a view for our sources (image and name)
    -create the corresponding viewholders
    -create the List in the class along with the constructor
    -implement all the methods (onBindViewHolder, onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType), getItemCount()) like before
    -once you click on the linearlayout (the root view for every item), launch MainActivity, make sure to pass the position of the item clicked
 6-Create a layout for MainActivity which will have a progressbar and recyclerview like mainactivity
 7-MainActivity will make a retrofit network call for all the sources
    -once you receive the response, create the adapter and populate the recyclerview
    -also store the source list in CommonStuff
 8-In MainActivity
    -retrieve the position passed from the SourceAdapter
    -retrieve the Source at that position from CommonStuff
    -update the original NewsAPI article call with the name and sortBy information from that source like so:
    ```
   Call<NewsApiArticleResponse> responseCall = NewsAPI.getNewsAPI().getArticles(source.getId(), source.getSortBysAvailable().get(0));
   ```
 9-This is because each source only supports a certain type of sortBy functionality and we just choose the first one
 
 -Day 4 -Fragment 1
 
 - Create a new Activity, call it SwipHomeActivity (Use New>Activity>Empty Activity)

	- Also give change its intent-filter to Main and Launcher, so that it launches when the app is opened
 - Write the retrofit API definition for the sources endpoint, which includes

	-getting a sample json response from newsapi.org
	-validating it in jsoneditoronline
	-creating the object (described before) in jsonshcematopojo
	-import the objects in our app
	-write a new method in our NewsAPI interface like so:
	```
	      @GET("sources")
	      Call<NewsApiSourcesResponse> getSources();
	```
- Add support for storing and retrieving the Sources in CommonStuff
  ```
public static List<Source> sources;
    public static List<Source> getSources() {
        return sources;
    }
    public static void setSources(List<Source> sources) {
        CommonStuff.sources = sources;
    }
  ```
- Create a Fragment called ListOfArticlesFragment, it is basically a reimplementation of MainActivity

	-it should override the following methods
		- override onCreate: get the position of the given source
		- onCreateView: inflate the activity_main view
		- onViewCreated: do the same thing as the old MainActivity#onCreate like getting references to the views, calling the api, handling the response
	- create a static method called generateFragment which takes a position and creates a ListOfArticlesFragment, use Bundle and setArguments to set arguments to the fragment
- In SwipeHomeActivity

	-create a ViewPagerAdapter which extends from FragmentStatePagerAdapter
	-implement the getItem and getCount methods
	-it should hold a List
	-the constructor should take a FragmentManager and List
	-update the getItem and getCount methods as required
	-Make a network response call for the sources endpoint using Retrofit
		-there, get the list of sources
		-store it in commongstuff
		-create a ViewPagerAdapter based on the List
		- set it on the adapter
